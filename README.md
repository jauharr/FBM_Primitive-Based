# FBM_Primitive-Based
CAD Application Unity Primitives
Build Envrionment
Unity 2.7f1 or higher
The methdo is Based on Primtivies
It uses the built in primitives from unity 
1. Cube as Rectangle
2. Cylinder
3. Capsule
4. Sphere
The primitives based on ProBuilder are
1. Cone
2. Prism

The assests requires in this application are
a) Pro Builder @ Unity Asset Store
b) pb_CSG @ https://github.com/karl-/pb_CSG

Pro Builder is an open source assest and is still under development. It adds up modeling functionality to unity and It may become a parmanent part of the Unity Engine.

For Mobile Application CAD developers:

It is recommended to use some brep modeler which is a geometric modeling kernel instead of Unity which is a mesh modeler.
Unity is memory intesive and is not great for CAD applications.
The geometric modeling Kernel from C3D labs will be a good idea.
